## Backend (Node.js + Express.js)

### **Authentication & User Management**
- **JWT-based Authentication**  
  Secure login, logout, and signup using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Google Authentication**  
  `/gmail-login` endpoint allows OAuth-based login through Gmail.

### **API Endpoints**

| **Endpoint** | **Method** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| `/sign-up` | POST | Register a new user |
| `/login` | POST | Authenticate a user and issue JWT |
| `/logout` | POST | Logout the user (invalidate token on frontend) |
| `/gmail-login` | POST | Login using Google OAuth |
| `/messages/:userId/:otherUserId` | GET / POST | Fetch or send chat messages |
| `/profile/view` | GET | View own profile |
| `/profile/edit` | PUT | Edit profile details |
| `/request/send/:status/:toUserId` | POST | Send connection request |
| `/request/recieve/:status/:fromUserId` | POST | Accept or reject a received request |
| `/requests/received` | GET | Get all pending connection requests |
| `/connections` | GET | Get list of connected developers |
| `/feed` | GET | Fetch list of suggested developers to connect with |

### **Database Models**
- **User**: Stores username, email, password hash, skills, bio, and profile picture.
- **Request**: Tracks connection requests between users with status (pending, accepted, rejected).
- **Message**: Stores chat messages, sender/receiver IDs, timestamps.
- **Connection**: Created upon mutual acceptance of requests.

### **Real-time Chat (Socket.IO)**
- Enables one-on-one messaging between connected users.
- Handles live updates for messages and connection status.
- Socket events: `message`, `newRequest`, `connectionUpdate`.
